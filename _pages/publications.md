## Theses

- **[Algebraic structures associated to double shuffle relations between multiple polylogrithm values at roots of unity](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04017713)** (PhD thesis, 2023).

*Supervisor*: Benjamin Enriquez.

We reformulate in terms of crossed product Racinet's construction related to the double shuffle and regularization relations between multiple polylogarithm values at roots of unity. Furthermore, for mutiple zeta values, Enriquez and Furusho showed that a double shuffle scheme is a torsor of isomorphisms relating de Rham and Betti objects. We generalize this result to the cyclotomic case.

- **[Stratification des actions de groupes reductifs sur des variétés affines](https://khalefyaddaden.github.io/assets/pdf/memoire_m2_unistra.pdf)** (Master thesis, 2018).

*Supervisor*: Daniel Panazolo.

Initiation to Mumford's Geometric Invariant Theory which is caracterized by actions of reductive groups on algebraic varieties. Then give a decomposition of the algebraic variety into a finite number of partitions which allows to a better understanding of the variety. This work is based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6811) of Victoria Hoskins.

- **[Métriques riemanniennes sur les groupoïdes de Lie](https://khalefyaddaden.github.io/assets/pdf/memoire_m2_usthb.pdf)** (Master thesis, 2017).

*Supervisor*: Yacine Aït Amrane.

We study the set-theoric groupoid structure and equip it with differential structure obtaining what is called a Lie groupoid. Then we consider its action on a smooth manifold. This aims to equip a Lie groupoid with a Riemannian metric with respect to the underlying metrics on the structure. This work is based on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5989) of Matias L. del Hoyo, Rui Loja Fernandes.
