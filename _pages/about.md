I am a temporary research and teaching assistant at University of Caen-Normandie (France). I teach within the [UFR des Sciences](https://ufr-sciences.unicaen.fr), and I am a member of the [GRAAL](https://lmno.unicaen.fr/decouvrir/organisation/equipe-geometrie-representations-algebre-analyse-logique-graal) research team at the [Laboratoire de Mathématiques Nicolas Oresme](https://lmno.unicaen.fr).

Before that I was a [JSPS](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-aboutus/index.html) Postdoctoral Research fellow in the Graduate School of Mathematics of Nagoya University (Japan) under Professor [Hidekazu Furusho](https://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~furusho/).

I did my Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Strasbourg (France) under the supervision of Professor Benjamin Enriquez.

I am interested in various aspects of multiple zeta values, their cyclotomic analogues the multiple polylogarithm values at roots of unity and their connections to associators and Grothendieck-Teïchmuller theory.
