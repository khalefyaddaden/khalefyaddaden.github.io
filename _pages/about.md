I am a [JSPS](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-aboutus/index.html) Postdoctoral Research fellow in the Graduate School of Mathematics of Nagoya University (Japan) under Professor [Hidekazu Furusho](https://www.math.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~furusho/).

I did my Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Strasbourg (France) under the supervision of Professor Benjamin Enriquez.

I am interested in various aspects of multiple zeta values, their cyclotomic analogues the multiple polylogarithm values at roots of unity and their connections to associators and Grothendieck-Te√Øchmuller theory.
