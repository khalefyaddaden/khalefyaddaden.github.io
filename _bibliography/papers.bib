  abstract={We provide a proof of a conjecture by Zhao concerning the structure of certain relations among cyclotomic multiple zeta values in weight two. We formulate this conjecture in a broader algebraic setting in which we give a natural equivalence between two schemes attached to a finite abelian group $G$. In particular, when $G$ is the group of roots of unity, these schemes describe the standard relations among cyclotomic multiple zeta values.}

  abstract={Racinet studied the scheme associated with the double shuffle and regularization relations between multiple polylogarithm values at Nth roots of unity and constructed a group scheme attached to the situation. Then, Enriquez and Furusho proved that this group scheme can be essentially identified with the stabilizer of a coproduct element arising in Racinet's theory with respect to the action of a group of automorphisms of a free Lie algebra. We reformulate Racinet's construction in terms of crossed products. We then establish a cyclotomic analogue of a stabilizer inclusion arising from Enriquez and Furusho's work. This yields an explicit group scheme containing Racinet's double shuffle group scheme, which we also express in the Racinet formalism.}

  abstract={We prove a cyclotomic generalization of Enriquez and Furusho's result stating that the scheme of double shuffle and regularization relations between multiple zeta values arising from Racinet's formalism is a torsor of isomorphisms between “Betti” and “de Rham” objects. After reviewing the “de Rham” objects arising from a crossed product interpretation of Racinet's formalism, we construct the “Betti” objects based on an orbifold fundamental group. We then show that the scheme of double shuffle and regularization relations is a subtorsor of stabilizer schemes relating “Betti” and “de Rham” coproducts.}
