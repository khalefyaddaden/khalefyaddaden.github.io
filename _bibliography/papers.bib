  abstract={We present an alternative Q-form for Racinet's cyclotomic double shuffle Lie algebra, inspired by the double shuffle relations among congruent multiple zeta values studied by Yuan and Zhao. Our main result establishes an invariance characterization theorem, demonstrating how these two Q-forms can be reconstructed from each other under Galois action.}

  abstract={Racinet studied the scheme associated with the double shuffle and regularization relations between multiple polylogarithm values at Nth roots of unity and constructed a group scheme attached to the situation. Then, Enriquez and Furusho proved that this group scheme can be essentially identified with the stabilizer of a coproduct element arising in Racinet's theory with respect to the action of a group of automorphisms of a free Lie algebra. We reformulate Racinet's construction in terms of crossed products. We then establish a cyclotomic analogue of a stabilizer inclusion arising from Enriquez and Furusho's work. This yields an explicit group scheme containing Racinet's double shuffle group scheme, which we also express in the Racinet formalism.}

  abstract={We prove a cyclotomic generalization of Enriquez and Furusho's result stating that the scheme of double shuffle and regularization relations between multiple zeta values arising from Racinet's formalism is a torsor of isomorphisms between “Betti” and “de Rham” objects. After reviewing the “de Rham” objects arising from a crossed product interpretation of Racinet's formalism, we construct the “Betti” objects based on an orbifold fundamental group. We then show that the scheme of double shuffle and regularization relations is a subtorsor of stabilizer schemes relating “Betti” and “de Rham” coproducts.}
