  abstract={In this paper, we introduce the notion of a bimodule with a factorization structure (BFS) and show that such a structure gives rise to an algebra morphism. We then prove that this framework offers an interpretation of the geometric construction underlying both the Betti and de Rham harmonic coproducts of the double shuffle theory developed in \cite{DeT, EF1, EF2, EF3}.}

  abstract={We provide a proof of a conjecture by Zhao concerning the structure of certain relations among cyclotomic multiple zeta values in weight two. We formulate this conjecture in a broader algebraic setting in which we give a natural equivalence between two schemes attached to a finite abelian group $G$. In particular, when $G$ is the group of roots of unity, these schemes describe the standard relations among cyclotomic multiple zeta values.}
