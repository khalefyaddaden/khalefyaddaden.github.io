  abstract={In a previous paper, the second author introduced a Betti counterpart of $N$-cyclotomic double shuffle theory for any $N \geq 1$. The construction is based on the group algebra of the free group $F_2$, endowed with a filtration relative to a morphism $F_2 \to \mu_N$ (where $\mu_N$ is the group of $N$-th roots of unity). One of the main results therein is the construction of a complete Hopf algebra coproduct $\widehat{\Delta}^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}_N$ on the relative completion of a specific subalgebra $\mathcal{W}^\mathrm{B}$ of the group algebra of $F_2$. However, an explicit formula for this coproduct is missing. In this paper, we show that the discrete Betti harmonic coproduct $\Delta^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}$ defined for the classical case ($N=1$) by the first author and Furusho remains compatible with the filtration structure on $\mathcal{W}^\mathrm{B}$ induced by the relative completion for arbitrary $N$. This compatibility suggests that the completion corresponding to $\Delta^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}$ is a candidate for an explicit realization of $\widehat{\Delta}^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}_N$.}

  abstract={In this paper, we introduce the notion of a bimodule with a factorization structure (BFS) and show that such a structure gives rise to an algebra morphism. We then prove that this framework offers an interpretation of the geometric construction underlying both the Betti and de Rham harmonic coproducts of the double shuffle theory developed in \cite{DeT, EF1, EF2, EF3}.}
